## Error Code Reference

Soroban contract errors are emitted as numeric enum discriminants. Error names
and values are scoped to each contract, so the same numeric value can mean
different things depending on which contract returned it.

### router-core `RouterError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the router has already been initialized. | Treat initialization as complete, or deploy a fresh contract if you need a new admin. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin-only helpers are called before `initialize` has stored the admin. | Initialize the router before calling configuration or admin reads. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the stored router admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `RouteNotFound` | 4 | A route or alias lookup targets a name that is not registered. | Register the route, check spelling, or remove stale aliases in the caller. |
| `RoutePaused` | 5 | `resolve` targets a route that has been individually paused. | Unpause the route or route traffic elsewhere. |
| `RouterPaused` | 6 | `resolve` is called while the global router pause is active. | Wait for recovery or have the admin call `set_paused(false)`. |
| `RouteAlreadyExists` | 7 | Registering a route or alias with a name that is already in use. | Choose a unique name or update/remove the existing route first. |
| `InvalidRouteName` | 8 | A route name is empty or only whitespace. | Send a non-empty, trimmed route name. |
| `InvalidMetadata` | 9 | Route metadata exceeds limits: description over 256 characters or more than 5 tags. | Shorten the description or reduce the tag list before submitting. |

### router-registry `RegistryError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the registry has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh registry for a new admin. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin-dependent registry operations run before initialization. | Initialize the registry before writes or admin reads. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the registry admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `NotFound` | 4 | No entry exists for the requested name/version, or no version satisfies a lookup. | Register the contract or adjust the requested name, version, or constraint. |
| `AlreadyRegistered` | 5 | The same `(name, version)` pair is registered twice. | Use a new version or deprecate old entries instead of overwriting. |
| `AlreadyDeprecated` | 6 | `deprecate` targets an entry that is already deprecated. | Treat the operation as already complete or choose another version. |
| `InvalidVersion` | 7 | Version is `0` or not greater than the current highest version for the name. | Use a positive version greater than existing versions. |
| `VersionNotFound` | 8 | `deprecate` targets a version that is not registered for the name. | Check `versions(name)` and retry with an existing version. |
| `InvalidConstraint` | 9 | A semver constraint cannot be parsed or uses an unsupported form. | Use exact, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `^`, or `~` constraints. |
| `AllVersionsDeprecated` | 10 | Lookup finds versions, but every matching entry is deprecated. | Register a newer active version or allow deprecated versions in the caller logic. |

### router-access `AccessError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the access contract has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh access contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Admin or role checks require the super-admin before it is stored. | Initialize the contract with a super-admin first. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller lacks super-admin or role-admin authority for the action. | Use an authorized signer or grant the required admin role first. |
| `AlreadyHasRole` | 4 | `grant_role` targets an address that already holds the role directly. | Treat as success, wait for expiry, or revoke before granting again. |
| `RoleNotFound` | 5 | `revoke_role` targets an address without that direct role grant. | Check `has_role` or role member lists before revoking. |
| `Blacklisted` | 6 | A blacklisted address is granted or checked for role access. | Unblacklist the address before granting roles. |
| `CannotBlacklistAdmin` | 7 | The caller tries to blacklist the super-admin address. | Transfer super-admin first, or choose another target. |
| `HierarchyCycle` | 8 | Setting a role admin would create a parent-role cycle. | Pick a role-admin hierarchy that does not point back to itself. |

### router-middleware `MiddlewareError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after middleware has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh middleware contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Middleware configuration or admin reads run before initialization. | Initialize the contract before route configuration. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the middleware admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `RateLimitExceeded` | 4 | A caller has used all allowed calls for the route's current window. | Retry after the window resets or raise the configured limit. |
| `RouteDisabled` | 5 | `pre_call` runs against a route whose middleware config is disabled. | Enable the route or bypass it intentionally. |
| `MiddlewareDisabled` | 6 | Global middleware enforcement is disabled. | Re-enable middleware or treat the route as temporarily unavailable. |
| `InvalidConfig` | 7 | Rate limiting is enabled with `max_calls_per_window > 0` but `window_seconds == 0`. | Set a positive window or set `max_calls_per_window` to `0` for unlimited calls. |
| `CircuitOpen` | 8 | The route's circuit breaker is open after repeated failures. | Wait for the recovery window, reset the breaker, or fix the failing downstream route. |

### router-timelock `TimelockError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after the timelock has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh timelock contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Timelock operations need the admin or delay before initialization. | Initialize the timelock with an admin and minimum delay. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the timelock admin. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `NotFound` | 4 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an unknown operation id. | Recompute the operation id or query the operation before acting. |
| `NotReady` | 5 | `execute` is called before the queued operation's ETA. | Wait until the ETA has passed. |
| `AlreadyExecuted` | 6 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an operation that has already executed. | Treat it as complete and avoid replaying the operation. |
| `Cancelled` | 7 | `execute` or `cancel` targets an operation that has been cancelled. | Queue a new operation if the action is still needed. |
| `DelayTooShort` | 8 | `queue` uses a delay lower than the configured minimum delay. | Use at least `min_delay()` seconds. |
| `Expired` | 9 | `execute` is called after `eta + grace_period_seconds`. | The operation window has closed; queue a new operation. |
| `InvalidDelay` | 10 | `initialize` or `set_min_delay` is called with `delay == 0`. | Provide a positive delay in seconds. |
| `InvalidConfig` | 11 | `set_emergency_council` is called with `required == 0` or `required > council.len()`. | Ensure `0 < required <= council.len()`; set M > N/2 for strict majority. |
| `NotCouncilMember` | 12 | `fast_track_approve` or `remove_council_member` targets an address not in the council. | Verify council membership with `is_council_member` before calling. |
| `FastTrackDisabled` | 13 | `fast_track_approve` is called while fast-track is disabled. | Enable fast-track via `set_fast_track_enabled(true)` before approving. |
| `AlreadyApproved` | 14 | A council member calls `fast_track_approve` for an op they already approved. | Each member may approve once per operation. |
| `AlreadyMember` | 15 | `add_council_member` targets an address already in the council. | The address is already a council member; no action needed. |

### router-multicall `MulticallError`

| Error | Value | When it occurs | How to handle it |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1 | `initialize` is called after multicall has already been initialized. | Skip initialization or deploy a fresh multicall contract. |
| `NotInitialized` | 2 | Batch execution or admin reads require config before initialization. | Initialize the contract with an admin and batch size. |
| `Unauthorized` | 3 | The caller is not the multicall admin for configuration changes. | Sign with the admin account or transfer admin first. |
| `BatchTooLarge` | 4 | `execute_batch` receives more calls than `max_batch_size`. | Split the batch or increase `max_batch_size`. |
| `EmptyBatch` | 5 | `execute_batch` is called with no calls. | Provide at least one call descriptor. |
| `RequiredCallFailed` | 6 | A required call in the batch fails. | Inspect per-call results, fix the failed required call, or mark it optional if safe. |
| `InvalidConfig` | 7 | `max_batch_size` is set to `0`. | Configure a positive maximum batch size. |

### `get_quote(router_core, route_name, token_in, token_out, amount_in, fee_bps, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`
Returns a quote for one liquidity plugin route. The call previews the swap result only; it does not execute a transfer.

**Errors:** `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `InvalidRoute`, `RouteNotFound`, `QuoteFailed`

---

### `get_multihop_quote(hops, amount_in, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`

**Errors:** `EmptyRoute`, `RouteTooLong`, `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`

---

### Quote Precision And Rounding

`exchange_rate` is returned as a fixed-point integer instead of a floating-point decimal:

```text
exchange_rate = floor(amount_out * 10^precision / amount_in)
```

`precision` is the number of decimal places encoded in `exchange_rate`. The contract accepts precision values from `1` through `18`; `6` is the typical default for UI and API clients.

For tokens with the same decimal count, convert the returned value to a human-readable rate like this:

```text
display_rate = exchange_rate / 10^precision
```

For tokens with different decimal counts, adjust for token base units:

```text
display_rate = (exchange_rate / 10^precision) * 10^(token_in_decimals - token_out_decimals)
```

Example with equal token decimals:

| `amount_in` | `amount_out` | `precision` | `exchange_rate` | Display rate |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `1_000000` | `2_000000` | `6` | `2_000000` | `2.000000` |
| `3_000000` | `1_000000` | `6` | `333333` | `0.333333` |

Rounding is deterministic and always truncates toward zero because Soroban integer division is used. The contract does not round up fractional remainders, so clients should treat the value as a floor estimate of the exact rate. Fee amounts and `min_amount_out` use the same integer-division behavior:

```text
fee_amount = floor(amount_in * fee_bps / 10_000)
min_amount_out = floor(amount_out * (10_000 - slippage_bps) / 10_000)
```

For UI display, keep the integer values for transaction decisions and apply formatting only at the presentation layer. For comparisons, compare fixed-point integers at the same `precision` rather than converting through floating-point numbers.

---

## router-middleware

**Contract:** `RouterMiddleware`  
**Purpose:** Pre/post call hooks with rate limiting and circuit breaker.

### `initialize(admin) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`

---

### `configure_route(caller, route, max_calls_per_window, window_seconds, enabled, failure_threshold, recovery_window_seconds) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
Configures rate limiting and circuit breaker for a route. Set `max_calls_per_window = 0` to disable rate limiting. Set `failure_threshold = 0` to disable the circuit breaker.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidConfig` (window_seconds=0 with max_calls>0), `NotInitialized`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <MIDDLEWARE_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- configure_route \
  --caller <ADMIN> --route oracle/get_price \
  --max_calls_per_window 100 --window_seconds 3600 \
  --enabled true --failure_threshold 5 --recovery_window_seconds 300
```

---

### `pre_call(caller, route) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
Must be called before routing. Validates global enable, route enable, circuit breaker, and rate limit. Increments `total_calls` on success.

**Errors:** `MiddlewareDisabled`, `RouteDisabled`, `CircuitOpen`, `RateLimitExceeded`

---

### `post_call(caller, route, success: bool)`
Must be called after routing. Emits `post_call` event. Increments circuit breaker failure count on failure.

---

### `transfer_admin(current, new_admin) → Result<(), MiddlewareError>`
**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

## router-timelock

**Contract:** `RouterTimelock`  
**Purpose:** Delayed execution queue — all sensitive changes must wait a configurable delay. An emergency council can bypass the delay via M-of-N fast-track approval.

### `initialize(admin, min_delay: u64) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
`min_delay` must be > 0 (seconds). Fast-track is disabled by default.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`, `InvalidDelay`

---

### `queue(proposer, description, target, delay: u64, grace_period_seconds: u64, deps: Vec<Bytes>) → Result<Bytes, TimelockError>`
Queues a new operation. Returns the op_id (SHA-256 of description + target + eta). `delay` must be >= `min_delay`. `grace_period_seconds` is the window after ETA during which the operation may be executed — after `eta + grace_period_seconds` the operation expires.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `DelayTooShort`, `NotInitialized`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <TIMELOCK_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- queue \
  --proposer <ADMIN> --description "upgrade oracle to v2" \

```

---

### `execute(caller, op_id: Bytes) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
Executes a queued operation after its ETA and before its grace period expires.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyExecuted`, `Cancelled`, `NotReady`, `Expired`

---

### `cancel(caller, op_id: Bytes) → Result<(), TimelockError>`

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyExecuted`, `Cancelled`

---

### `get_op(op_id: Bytes) → Option<Op>`
Returns the operation, or `None` if not found.

---

### `get_operation_status(op_id: Bytes) → Option<OperationStatus>`
Returns the human-readable status (`Queued`, `Ready`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`, `Expired`), or `None` if not found.

---

### `min_delay() → u64`
Returns the configured minimum delay in seconds.

---

### `set_min_delay(caller, new_delay: u64) → Result<(), TimelockError>`

---

### `get_pending_op_count() → u64`
Returns the number of operations that are queued but not yet executed or cancelled.

---

## router-timelock — Emergency Council & Fast-Track

The emergency council is a set of trusted addresses that can fast-track a queued
operation without waiting for the normal ETA. Fast-track is **disabled by default**
and should only be enabled during active emergencies.

**Security invariant:** Set M (required approvals) to at least ⌈N/2⌉ + 1 (strict majority).
Council membership can only be changed via standard (non-fast-track) admin calls.

### `set_emergency_council(caller, council: Vec<Address>, required: u32) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
Batch-replaces the council list and sets the required-approval threshold M. `required` must satisfy `0 < required <= council.len()`.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidConfig`, `NotInitialized`

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <TIMELOCK_ID> --network testnet --source admin \
  -- set_emergency_council \
  --caller <ADMIN> --council '["<ADDR1>","<ADDR2>","<ADDR3>"]' --required 2
```

---

### `add_council_member(caller, member: Address) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
Adds a single address to the emergency council. Only the admin may call this.
Council updates are standard (non-fast-track) calls and therefore subject to `min_delay` when queued.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `AlreadyMember`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `remove_council_member(caller, member: Address) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
Removes a single address from the emergency council. Only the admin may call this.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotCouncilMember`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `fast_track_approve(member, op_id: Bytes) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
A council member approves a queued operation for fast-track execution. Each member may approve once. When the approval count reaches `required_approvals` (M-of-N), the operation executes immediately — bypassing the normal ETA — and a `critical_fast_tracked` event is emitted.

**Errors:** `FastTrackDisabled`, `NotCouncilMember`, `NotFound`, `AlreadyExecuted`, `Cancelled`, `AlreadyApproved`

---

### `set_fast_track_enabled(caller, enabled: bool) → Result<(), TimelockError>`
Enables or disables the fast-track execution path. Fast-track is **disabled by default**.
Disable again after an emergency is resolved.

**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `get_fast_track_enabled() → bool`
Returns whether fast-track is currently enabled.

---

### `get_council() → Vec<Address>`
Returns the current emergency council member list.

---

### `get_required_approvals() → u32`
Returns M — the number of approvals required for fast-track execution.

---

### `is_council_member(addr: Address) → bool`
Returns `true` if `addr` is in the emergency council.

---

### `get_fast_track_approvals(op_id: Bytes) → Vec<Address>`
Returns the list of council members who have approved the given operation.

---

## router-multicall

**Contract:** `RouterMulticall`  
**Purpose:** Batch multiple cross-contract calls in a single transaction.

### `initialize(admin, max_batch_size: u32) → Result<(), MulticallError>`
`max_batch_size` must be > 0.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`, `InvalidConfig`

---

### `execute_batch(caller, calls: Vec<CallDescriptor>, simulate: bool) → Result<BatchSummary, MulticallError>`
Executes a batch of calls. Any authenticated address can call this (not admin-only). If `simulate = true`, calls are attempted but `total_batches` is not incremented. If a call with `required = true` fails, the batch aborts immediately.

**Errors:** `EmptyBatch`, `BatchTooLarge`, `RequiredCallFailed`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `set_max_batch_size(caller, max_batch_size: u32) → Result<(), MulticallError>`
**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `InvalidConfig`, `NotInitialized`

---

### `total_batches() → u64`
Cumulative count of non-simulated `execute_batch` calls.

---

### `max_batch_size() → Result<u32, MulticallError>`
**Errors:** `NotInitialized`

---

### `admin() → Result<Address, MulticallError>`
**Errors:** `NotInitialized`

---

### `transfer_admin(current, new_admin) → Result<(), MulticallError>`
**Errors:** `Unauthorized`, `NotInitialized`

---

## router-quote

**Contract:** `RouterQuote`  
**Purpose:** Price quoting for token swaps — calculates expected output amounts, fees, and exchange rates without executing transactions.

### `get_quote(plugin, route_name, token_in, token_out, amount_in, fee_bps, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`

Gets a single-hop quote from a liquidity plugin. Returns expected output, fees, exchange rate, and price impact.

**Parameters:**
- `plugin` - Address of the liquidity plugin contract
- `route_name` - Route identifier
- `token_in` - Input token address
- `token_out` - Output token address
- `amount_in` - Amount to swap (must be > 0)
- `fee_bps` - Protocol fee in basis points
- `slippage_bps` - Slippage tolerance in basis points (0–10000)
- `precision` - Decimal places for exchange rate (1–18, typically 6)

**Errors:** `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`, `RouteNotFound`

---

### `get_multihop_quote(hops, amount_in, slippage_bps, precision) → Result<QuoteResponse, QuoteError>`

Gets a multi-hop quote chaining multiple liquidity plugins. Returns end-to-end exchange rate and per-hop breakdown.

**Parameters:**
- `hops` - Ordered list of `HopDescriptor` (1–5 hops)
- `amount_in` - Initial input amount (must be > 0)
- `slippage_bps` - Slippage tolerance applied to final output (0–10000)
- `precision` - Decimal places for end-to-end exchange rate (1–18)

**Errors:** `EmptyRoute`, `RouteTooLong`, `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidPrecision`, `InvalidSlippage`, `QuoteFailed`

### Exchange Rate Precision and Rounding

The `exchange_rate` field uses **fixed-point arithmetic** to represent decimal values as integers, avoiding floating-point precision issues on-chain.

#### Formula

```
exchange_rate = (amount_out * 10^precision) / amount_in
```

#### Precision Values

- **Range:** 1–18 decimal places
- **Typical value:** 6 (supports micro-precision)
- **Configured per-quote:** Caller specifies precision when requesting a quote

#### Converting to Decimal

To convert the fixed-point `exchange_rate` to a decimal value:

```
decimal_rate = exchange_rate / 10^precision
```

**Examples:**
- `exchange_rate = 2_000_000`, `precision = 6` → `2.000000`
- `exchange_rate = 1_050_000`, `precision = 6` → `1.050000`
- `exchange_rate = 200`, `precision = 2` → `2.00`

#### Rounding Behavior

The calculation uses **integer division**, which **truncates (rounds down)** toward zero. This is deterministic and avoids banker's rounding or floating-point ambiguity.

**Example with truncation:**
```
amount_in = 3
amount_out = 10
precision = 6

exchange_rate = (10 * 1_000_000) / 3 = 3_333_333
decimal_rate = 3.333333 (truncated from 3.333333...)
```

#### Token Decimal Considerations

When working with tokens that have different decimal places:

1. **Token amounts** are in the token's native units (e.g., 1 USDC = 1_000_000 units for 6 decimals)
2. **Exchange rate precision** is independent of token decimals — it controls the rate's decimal representation
3. **Conversion example:**
   - Token A has 6 decimals, Token B has 18 decimals
   - Swap 1_000_000 Token A (1.0 Token A) for 5_000_000_000_000_000_000 Token B (5.0 Token B)
   - With `precision = 6`: `exchange_rate = (5_000_000_000_000_000_000 * 10^6) / 1_000_000 = 5_000_000_000_000_000`
   - Decimal rate: `5.0` (5 Token B per 1 Token A)

#### Best Practices

- Use `precision = 6` for most use cases (micro-precision)
- Use higher precision (12–18) for high-value or low-decimal tokens
- Always check the `precision` field when interpreting `exchange_rate`
- Account for truncation when calculating expected outputs client-side

## Error Code Reference

Each contract defines its own `#[contracterror]` enum. Use the tables below as the canonical error-code reference for integration, monitoring, and client-side handling.

### router-core (`RouterError`)

| Error | Code | When it occurs | How to handle |
|---|---:|---|---|
